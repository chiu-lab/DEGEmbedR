Description: 
    DEGEmbedR enables statistical hypothesis testing of gene–function relationships using embedding representations derived from large language models (LLMs). The package provides
    tools to:
    (i) GeneratePathwayDescription: generate function descriptions from names using GPT-4o
         (e.g., for biological pathways or drug mechanisms of action),
    (ii) GenerateTextEmbedding: compute function embeddings from user- or GPT-4o-generated
         function descriptions, and
    (iii) RunDEGEmbedR (main function): perform nonparametric statistical testing of 
          gene–function cosine similarity distributions between differentially expressed genes 
          (DEGs) and background genes.
    DEGEmbedR is designed specifically for human genes. It supports a curated background of 
    ~18k human protein-coding genes from the NCBI Gene database, and all built-in annotations 
    and similarity matrices are human-specific.
    The framework supports both curated functional collections (such as MSigDB GO Biological 
    Processes, MSigDB Canonical Pathways, and mechanisms of action [MOA]) and custom, 
    user-supplied embeddings. It facilitates gene–function association testing where predefined 
    gene sets are unavailable and enables statistical assessment of novel biological hypotheses 
    inferred from LLMs.
